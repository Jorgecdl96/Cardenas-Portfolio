# Cardenas Portfolio

## Description

This project has been created with help of the following languages:

* HTML
* CSS

This is my Portfolio where you will be able to see all the most important projects I have been worked with. Actually we can see below the project-1 of this BootCamp named as Wolfinance, where we can be able to improve our personal finances, keeping track of each of our daily expenses.

You will find the following homeworks added to my Portfolio:

* Day Planner
* Horiseon
* Weather Dashboard

In my portfolio as you can see below, it is structured with a header with my name and a nav section with links that follows you to my work, contact info, a little story about me and my Resume where you will be able to see my expirience and my actual job.

You can access to my GitHub and LinkedIn account by clickcing in the links below at "Contact Me" section.

The website was design with help of media queries to be able to adapt to any screen size.
