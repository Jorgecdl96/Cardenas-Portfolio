# Cardenas Portfolio

## Description

This is my Portfolio where you will be able to see all the most important projects I have been worked with. Actually there is only one project uploaded that you could find in the website named as Horiseon and you can click on the image and will open a new page where you will be able to see the Horiseon project, the rest of them are still only images that helps to give a better structure and presentation to my portfolio.

In my portfolio as you can see below, it is structured with a header with my name and a nav section with links that follows you to my work, contact info and a little story about me.

The website was design with help of media queries to be able to adapt to any screen size.
